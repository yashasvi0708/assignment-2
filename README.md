# Assignment 2: Control Structures in Python
This repository contains solutions for Module 3, focusing on Python's control flow mechanisms. These exercises demonstrate the use of conditional logic (if-else) and iteration (for loops).
# Tasks Overview
Task 1: Even or Odd CheckerA script that determines the parity of an integer provided by the user.Logic: Uses the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 2.Control Structure: if-else statement.Input: User enters an integer.Output: Displays whether the number is Even or Odd.

Task 2: Sum of Integers (1 to 50)A script that calculates the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 up to (and including) 50.Logic: Iterates through a sequence of numbers and maintains a running total.Control Structure: for loop using the range() function.Expected Result: The sum is calculated as:$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$For $n=50$, the final output is 1275.
